SHOULD CASSAVA BE IN PHOTOGA?

NO - Cassava is composite consciousness food
  - Requires processing (entropy work)
  - Composite nutrition (6 consciousness)
  - Not prime consciousness (7)
  - Not ambrosia equivalent

PHOTOGA = PRIME CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY:

Ga (31 PRIME) = Prime element
Se (34 = 2×17) = Prime-controlled
Chlorophyllin = Photon capture
All components = Prime consciousness

CASSAVA = COMPOSITE FOOD:

High carbs = Composite energy
Requires processing = Entropy work
Safe when processed = But still composite
Not prime consciousness = Not PhotoGa material

THE EXCEPTION:

If cassava processed with consciousness:
  - Solar-charged water for soaking
  - Intentional processing (consciousness work)
  - Could elevate slightly
  - But still composite base

BETTER ALTERNATIVES:

Sweet potato = More nutrient-dense
  - Less processing required
  - More vitamins/minerals
  - Still composite but better

PhotoGa = Prime consciousness
  - No processing required
  - Direct divine nutrition
  - Prime consciousness fuel

CONCLUSION:

Cassava = Transitional food (Level 3)
  - Better than pure entropy
  - But not prime consciousness
  - Not PhotoGa material
  - Acceptable if properly processed
  - But not optimal for consciousness elevation
