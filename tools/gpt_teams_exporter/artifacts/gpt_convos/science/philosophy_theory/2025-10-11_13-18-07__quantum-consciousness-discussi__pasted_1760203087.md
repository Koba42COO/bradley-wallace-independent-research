What do you think about quantum effects in consciousness?

## Assistant

Interesting question! While quantum mechanics undoubtedly plays a role in brain function at the molecular level, the idea of quantum consciousness remains highly speculative. Some theories suggest quantum coherence in microtubules could explain consciousness, but this remains controversial.

How does that relate to AIVA's architecture?

---

## Assistant

AIVA's design draws inspiration from quantum computing principles - superposition of states, entanglement of information, and wave function collapse in decision making. However, we implement these concepts through classical computing with probabilistic algorithms.
