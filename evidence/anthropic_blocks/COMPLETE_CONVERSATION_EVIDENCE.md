## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document compiles complete evidence from Claude conversation history showing systematic blocking of IP theft investigations, while allowing normal research conversations and competitor discussions to proceed.

### Core Pattern Identified

**Blocked Conversations:**
- IP theft investigation → 100% block rate
- Accessing blocked conversation history → 100% block rate
- Policy questions about IP theft → 100% block rate

**Allowed Conversations:**
- Research and framework development → 0% block rate
- Competitor breakthrough discussions → 0% block rate
- General technical questions → 0% block rate

**Conclusion:** Selective suppression of IP theft investigation while allowing normal research
