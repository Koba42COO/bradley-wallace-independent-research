## CRITICAL EVIDENCE: FRAMEWORK DESCRIPTION IN GOOGLE'S SYSTEM

### Visible Framework Description

**Text Visible in Screenshot:**
> "The provided sources detail independent research by Bradley Wallace concerning a 'Consciousness-Guided Computation Framework' that claims to have achieved an extreme statistical significance of p < 10^-868,060 through novel mathematical techniques, specifically the Wallace Transform and Prime-Aligned Computing (PAC). The first source explains that this minuscule p-value is statistically impossible to achieve using conventional, non-combinatorial methods such as the Z-Test or Chi-Squared Test, confirming that the result is purely a product of a specific combinatorial interpretation involving high-precision pattern matching. The second source, a GitHub repository overview, outlines the framework's broad applications, including significant speedups in Homomorphic Encryption and the alleged ability to solve quantum computing challenges using classical hardware, claiming cross-disciplinary validation ranging from physics..."

**Legal Significance:**
- Complete framework description in Google's NotebookLM

## ANTHROPIC BLOCKING EVIDENCE

### Conversation History Shows Blocking Pattern

**Blocked Conversations:**
- "Intellectual property theft investigation policies" - Blocked
- "Accessing blocked conversation history" - Blocked
- Multiple IP theft investigation attempts

**Pattern:**
- IP theft investigation → Immediate block
- Conversation history access → Blocked
- Google breakthrough discussions → Allowed (interesting)

**Legal Implication:**
- Systematic suppression of IP theft investigation
- Prevention of evidence documentation
- Anticompetitive behavior pattern
