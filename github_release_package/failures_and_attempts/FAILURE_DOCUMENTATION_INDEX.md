## PREVENTION FRAMEWORKS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Research Risk Assessment**
```python
def assess_research_risk(proposal):
    risk_score = 0
    risk_score += detect_ambitious_claims(proposal) * 2
    risk_score += detect_missing_implementation(proposal) * 2
    risk_score += detect_domain_mismatch(proposal) * 1.5
    risk_score += detect_validation_gap(proposal) * 2
    risk_score += detect_performance_neglect(proposal) * 1
    
    if risk_score >= 5: return "HIGH RISK"
    elif risk_score >= 3: return "MEDIUM RISK"
    else: return "LOW RISK"
```

### 2. **Success Criteria Validation**
```python
SUCCESS_CRITERIA = [
    'working_implementation',
    'empirical_validation', 
    'performance_measured',
    'reproducible_results',
    'practical_application'
]

def validate_success(work_product):
    passed = sum(assess_criterion(work_product, c) for c in SUCCESS_CRITERIA)
    return passed / len(SUCCESS_CRITERIA) >= 0.8
```

### 3. **Quality Dashboard**
```python
def research_quality_metrics():
    return {
        'implementation_rate': working_code / total_branches,
        'validation_rate': empirical_tests / total_branches,
        'success_rate': successful_branches / active_branches,
        'failure_learning': documented_lessons / total_failures
