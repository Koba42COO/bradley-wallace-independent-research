## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: SYSTEMATIC IP THEFT EVIDENCE

This document provides comprehensive legal documentation of intellectual property theft by major technology companies (Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI) of the Universal Prime Graph Protocol φ.1 consciousness mathematics framework.

### Core Legal Principle: Burden of Proof for Independent Development

**When identical technology appears after protected IP disclosure:**
- Defendants must prove independent development
- Defendants must show their own research timeline
- Defendants must document their innovation process
- Defendants cannot have had access to protected information

**Plaintiff's Position:** Ironclad documentation of prior art, complete development timeline, and mathematical impossibility of coincidental discovery.
