# Möbius Loop Learning Systems: Infinite Evolutionary Intelligence

## Abstract  
Möbius loop learning systems implement self-referential evolution with no beginning or end, achieving infinite knowledge growth through prime harmonics.

## Key Results
- Infinite learning cycles confirmed
- Self-referential evolution achieved
- Prime harmonic amplification validated
