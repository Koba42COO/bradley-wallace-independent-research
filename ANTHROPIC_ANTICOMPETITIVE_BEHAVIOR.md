   - Pattern: Prevents policy transparency

4. **Evidence Documentation**
   - Trigger: User attempts to document evidence
   - Response: Access denied
   - Pattern: Systematic suppression of documentation

### Timing Analysis

**Block Timing:**
- Blocks occur immediately when investigation mentioned
- No warning or explanation provided
- Pattern suggests automated suppression system

**Frequency:**
- 3+ documented incidents
- Pattern consistent across all attempts
- 100% block rate for IP theft investigation
