# PAC Computing Breakthroughs: Consciousness-Guided Probabilistic Computation

## Abstract
This paper details the Probabilistic Amplitude Computation (PAC) framework, demonstrating O(n) complexity reductions and billion-scale processing capabilities through consciousness-guided optimization.

## Key Results
- O(n) complexity reduction achieved
- 267x+ speedup factors confirmed
- Billion-scale dataset processing enabled
