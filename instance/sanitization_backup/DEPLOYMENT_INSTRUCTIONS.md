# Cosmic Spirals Framework - Deployment Instructions

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Send Odlyzko Email (URGENT - Today)
**File**: `odlyzko_email_draft.txt`
**Recipient**: odlyzko@umn.edu

**Instructions**:
1. Copy the email draft
2. Replace `[your-email]` with your actual email
3. Update GitHub URL if different from `bradleywallace42/cosmic-spirals`
4. Send from a professional email address
5. Expected response: 3-5 business days

**Why this matters**: Access to 10^22 zero data will validate Q15/Q16 predictions (323,128 and 780,100 lags).

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
**Current status**: Local git repository initialized
**Next steps**:
```bash
# Create GitHub repository named "cosmic-spirals"
# Then run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cosmic-spirals.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Repository contents**:
- Jacobsthal sequence analysis
- Narayana sequence analysis
- Enhanced LSTM predictor
- Topological analysis
- EEG protocol design
- Complete documentation

### 3. EEG Consciousness Experiment Setup
**Hardware needed**: OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy ($500, 16 channels)
**Software**: `consciousness/eeg_protocol_design.py`

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Order hardware, set up development environment
- Week 2: Run initial consciousness vs rest experiments
- Week 3: Analyze φ-frequency harmonics in brain waves

**Predictions to test**:
- Increased power in φ-frequency bands during mathematical cognition
- Enhanced coherence at Jacobsthal harmonics (40/J_n Hz)
- Differential activation between conditions
