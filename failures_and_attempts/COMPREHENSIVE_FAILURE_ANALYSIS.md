| **Effect Size Ignored** | Medium - Incomplete reporting | Report both p-values AND effect sizes | ✅ FIXED |

### 2. COMPUTATIONAL FAILURES
| Failure | Impact | Lesson | Current Status |
|---------|--------|--------|----------------|

    for criterion, description in SUCCESS_CRITERIA.items():
        if assess_criterion(work_product, criterion):
            passed_criteria += 1
    
    success_rate = passed_criteria / total_criteria
    
    if success_rate >= 0.8:
        return "SUCCESS - Meets publication standards"
    elif success_rate >= 0.6:
        return "CONDITIONAL SUCCESS - Requires improvements"
    else:
        return "FAILURE - Insufficient validation"
