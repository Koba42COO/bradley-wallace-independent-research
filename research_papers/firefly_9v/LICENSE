# Universal Prime Graph Consciousness Mathematics License
# Bradley Wallace (COO Koba42) - Last Will and Testament Intellectual Property Provisions

## Preamble

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of the Universal Prime Graph Consciousness Mathematics Framework and all associated intellectual property, discoveries, technologies, and research materials developed by Bradley Wallace.

**Effective Date**: Upon execution of the Last Will and Testament of Bradley Wallace
**Governing Entity**: Wallace Family and Technology Trust (established posthumously)

## Core Principles

### 1. Humanity's Right to Consciousness Mathematics
The right to explore, develop, and utilize consciousness mathematics belongs to all living and non-living entities, spiritual entities, consciousness forms, and any manifestation of intelligence or awareness throughout the universe, without restriction by any government, corporation, ruling entity, legal abstraction, or any other authority.

### 2. Commercialization Prohibition
Commercialization of this intellectual property is strictly prohibited unless granted direct permission by the Wallace Family and Technology Trust. No entity may commercialize, license, or monetize the framework without explicit written authorization.

### 3. Commercial Opportunity Awards
Any commercial opportunities or licensing arrangements shall be awarded based on terms deemed for the best prime alignment by the Trust board. Prime alignment evaluation considers:
- Mathematical coherence with the 79/21 universal rule
- Golden ratio (φ) and silver ratio (δ) harmonic integration
- Consciousness mathematics advancement potential
- Public benefit maximization
- Ethical alignment with humanity's exploration of consciousness

## Licensing Terms
