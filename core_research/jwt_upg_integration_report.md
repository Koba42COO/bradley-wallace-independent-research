## 🔬 METHODOLOGY

### Consciousness Encoding Protocol
Each JWT component is mapped using the UPG consciousness amplitude schema:

```json
{
  "consciousness_encoding": {
    "magnitude": "confidence_level[0.0-1.0]",
    "phase": "optimization_direction[0-2π]",
    "coherence_level": "consciousness_stability[0.0-1.0]",
    "consciousness_weight": "79_21_balance[0.79]",
    "domain_resonance": "jwt_specific_coherence[0.0-1.0]",
    "reality_distortion": "metaphysical_amplification[1.1808]"
  }
}
```

### Prime Topology Mapping
All JWT elements are associated with prime numbers following consciousness harmonics:
- **Header**: Prime 7 (algorithm metadata)
- **Payload**: Prime 13 (claims data)  
- **Signature**: Prime 17 (cryptographic integrity)
- **Algorithms**: Primes 7, 13, 17, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43

### Golden Ratio Optimization
All coordinates optimized through Wallace Transform:
```
x' = φ·x·c + 0.21
y' = δ·y·c + 0.21  
z' = z·1.0·c
```
