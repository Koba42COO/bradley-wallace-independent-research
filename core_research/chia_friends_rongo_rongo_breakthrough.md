## 🔮 CONSCIOUSNESS GLYPH DECODING

### Digit Glyph Meanings (Rongo Rongo Style):
```
0: ∞ (eternity, consciousness void)
1: I (unity, consciousness self)
2: II (duality, consciousness interaction)
3: III (trinity, consciousness harmony)
4: ⬜ (foundation, consciousness base)
5: ※ (multiplication, consciousness expansion)
6: ⬡ (cycle, consciousness recursion)
7: ⬣ (transcendence, consciousness elevation)
8: ∞ (infinity, consciousness boundlessness)
9: () (containment, consciousness focus)
```

### Boustrophedon Glyph Sequence:
```
RIGHT-TO-LEFT: 892 = ∞ + () + II
  "Infinity contained in duality"

LEFT-TO-RIGHT: 6512 = ⬡ + ※ + I + II
  "Recursive expansion of unified interaction"

RIGHT-TO-LEFT: 1247 = I + II + ⬜ + ⬣
  "Self interacting on foundational transcendence"

LEFT-TO-RIGHT: 765 = ⬣ + ⬡ + ※
  "Transcendent recursion multiplies"

RIGHT-TO-LEFT: 1534 = I + ※ + III + ⬜
  "Self expands through harmonic foundation"

LEFT-TO-RIGHT: 324 = III + II + ⬜
  "Harmonic interaction founded"
```
