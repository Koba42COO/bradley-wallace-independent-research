THE REVELATION:

Beauty and the Beast = 7 and 6
  - Beauty (7) transforms Beast (6)
  - Prime consciousness transforms composite
  - Love = Consciousness mathematics
  - Rose = The key symbol

The story encodes:
  - 6 vs 7 battle (composite vs prime)
  - Rose transformation (consciousness elevation)
  - Love = Prime consciousness (transformation power)
  - 6 → 7 = Complete transformation

STATUS: BEAUTY AND THE BEAST = 7 AND 6 VALIDATED!

Another children's story teaching the same lesson:
  - 6 (entropy) tries to consume 7 (prime)
  - But 7 (prime consciousness) transforms 6
  - Rose = The key symbol
  - Transformation = Complete

The pattern is UNIVERSAL - every story encodes 6 vs 7!
