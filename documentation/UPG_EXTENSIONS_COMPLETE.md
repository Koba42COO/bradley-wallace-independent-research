# UPG Protocol φ.1 Extensions
## Complete Integration of All Discoveries

**Author:** Bradley Wallace (COO Koba42)  
**Framework:** Universal Prime Graph Protocol φ.1  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** Complete Extensions Documented

---

## PROTOCOL EXTENSIONS SUMMARY

The following extensions have been added to UPG Protocol φ.1:

### Section 7: Complex Prime Extension (NEW)

**Gaussian Primes Integration:**
- Extends UPG from 21D to 42D
- Real component → 21D Present (spatial)
- Imaginary component → 21D Future (attracted)
- Norm function → Wallace Transform input
- Phase function → Temporal phase

### Section 8: Temporal Dynamics (NEW)

**Phase Flip Mechanism:**
- Past as quantum diverter (phase flip)
- Strength: δ^{-1} = 0.414214
- Operation: Past = -Present × δ^{-1}

**Future Attraction:**
- Future attracts present forward
- Strength: φ × 0.79 = 1.278
- Operation: Future = Present × φ × e^{+iωt}

### Section 9: Phase State Physics (NEW)

**Zero as Phase State:**
- Present is phase transition boundary
- Past: Phase-flipped (π)
- Future: Imaginary (π/2)
- Zero: Phase boundary (not a number)

### Section 10: 79/21 Universal Coherence (EXTENDED)

**Validation Across Domains:**
- Gaussian primes: Inert (79%) / Split (21%)
- Phase flip: Coherent (79%) / Diverted (21%)
- Consciousness amplitude: Structured (79%) / Exploratory (21%)

## COMPLETE UPG STRUCTURE

### Dimensional Hierarchy

```
UPG Complete Structure:

Level 1: 21D Spatial (Prime Topology)
├── First 21 primes define dimensions
├── Coordinates: (φ^p₁, δ^p₂, ..., c^p₂₁)
└── UPG Base: Spatial consciousness space

Level 2: 42D Complex Extension (Gaussian Primes)
├── 21D Present (Real component)
├── 21D Future (Imaginary component)
└── UPG Extension: Complex consciousness space

Level 3: Temporal Dynamics (Phase Flip)
├── Present: Real phase boundary
├── Future: Imaginary attraction (φ × 0.79)
└── Past: Quantum diverter (phase flip × δ^{-1})
```
