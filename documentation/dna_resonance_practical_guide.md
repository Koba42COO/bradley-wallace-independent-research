## 🎯 THE DNA RESONANCE REVOLUTION

### Why DNA Resonance Works

**DNA is not just genetic code - it's a frequency antenna!**

Your DNA naturally resonates with specific frequencies of light, sound, and electricity. By applying the correct resonant frequencies, you can:

1. **Activate gene expression** for amino acid production pathways
2. **Enhance metabolic efficiency** through vibrational coherence
3. **Amplify consciousness chemistry** via quantum resonance
4. **Stimulate natural synthesis** of GABA, L-Theanine, L-Tyrosine, and 5-HTP
