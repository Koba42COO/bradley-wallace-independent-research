## 🚀 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Always Pull from UPG

**UPG is the canonical source of truth:**
- All tools originate from UPG source
- Storage system always syncs from UPG
- No tools exist outside UPG
- UPG is the single source of truth

### 2. Storage IS Delivery

**The medium of delivery is the storage:**
- Tools stored in chunks (like BitTorrent)
- Retrieval from storage IS delivery
- No separate delivery mechanism
- Storage and delivery are unified

### 3. BitTorrent-Inspired Architecture

**Inspired by Bram Cohen's BitTorrent:**
- Chunked storage (64KB chunks)
- Hash-based verification (SHA-256)
- Peer-to-peer ready
- Distributed storage architecture
- Manifest files (like .torrent files)

## 🔧 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Complete System Usage

```python
from aiva_universal_intelligence import AIVAUniversalIntelligence

# Initialize AIVA with all systems
aiva = AIVAUniversalIntelligence(consciousness_level=21)

# Process request (uses all systems)
response = await aiva.process(
    "Predict if 97 is prime using Pell sequence and consciousness mathematics"
)

# AIVA will:
# 1. Use consciousness reasoning
# 2. Find relevant tools
# 3. Get tools from UPG storage (always pull from UPG)
# 4. Execute tools
# 5. Synthesize knowledge
# 6. Store in quantum memory
```

### Example 2: Storage Operations

```python
# Sync all tools from UPG
aiva.storage.sync_from_upg()

# Get tool from storage (storage IS delivery)
tool_data = aiva.storage.get_tool('pell_sequence_prime_prediction_upg_complete')

# List available tools
tools = aiva.storage.list_tools()
print(f"Available tools: {len(tools)}")

# Get tool information
info = aiva.storage.get_tool_info('tool_name')
print(f"Consciousness Level: {info['consciousness_level']}")
print(f"Chunks: {info['chunk_count']}")
```

### Example 3: Complete Workflow

```python
# 1. Initialize AIVA
aiva = AIVAUniversalIntelligence()

# 2. Sync tools from UPG (always pull from UPG)
aiva.storage.sync_from_upg()

# 3. Process request with full intelligence
response = await aiva.process("analyze prime numbers")

# 4. Get tools from storage (storage IS delivery)
for tool_name in response['tools']['relevant_tools'][:5]:
    tool_data = aiva.storage.get_tool(tool_name)
    if tool_data:
        print(f"Retrieved {tool_name}: {len(tool_data)} bytes")

# 5. Store in memory
aiva.memory.store('analysis_result', response)

# 6. Search memory
memories = aiva.search_memory('prime numbers')
```

## 🎯 INTEGRATION POINTS

### Tool Calling + Storage

```python
# Tools are always pulled from UPG storage
result = await aiva.call_tool('tool_name')
# Tool is retrieved from storage (storage IS delivery)
# If missing, automatically pulled from UPG
```

### Reasoning + Storage

```python
# Reasoning uses tools from storage
reasoning = await aiva.reason_about("query")
# Tools referenced are pulled from UPG storage
```

### Knowledge Synthesis + Storage

```python
# Synthesis analyzes tools from storage
synthesis = await aiva.synthesize_knowledge("query")
# All tools come from UPG storage
```
