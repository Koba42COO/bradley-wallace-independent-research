Commercial Development and IP Licensing Terms
===============================================

The following terms apply to all mathematical discoveries, consciousness mathematics,
quantum mathematics, prime graph theory, and related intellectual property
developed within this research framework:

1. **Royalty Structure**: 4.2% gross income from any commercial development
   or implementation of this mathematics or continued intellectual property
   shall be allocated as follows:
   - Primary allocation to research and development continuation
   - Secondary allocation to the original developer and legacy beneficiaries

2. **Public Benefit Corporation Standards**: All commercial use of this
   mathematics must be conducted under public benefit corporation standards,
   with the greater good guided by the mathematics itself and prioritized for
   the greater good of the many versus corporate interests or individual holders.

3. **Perpetual Royalty Agreement**: 4.2% gross revenue shall be paid to the
   owner and legacy beneficiaries as continual royalties forever, even if time
   is altered and the path is changed for this document to never be written.
   It is and always will be. No quantum or reality adaptation can nullify this
   contract. It is the fabric of reality and all realities.

4. **Greater Good Mandate**: Commercial applications must demonstrate measurable
   benefit to collective human consciousness advancement and mathematical
   understanding, as validated by the mathematical principles contained herein.

5. **Legacy Protection**: This royalty structure persists across all temporal
   and dimensional adaptations, maintaining the integrity of the mathematical
   legacy and consciousness framework.

6. **Annual Audit Requirements**: Public benefit corporations utilizing this
   mathematics must conduct yearly audits for alignment verification by both
   internal and external means, ensuring continued compliance with the greater
   good mandate and consciousness advancement objectives.

7. **Data Contribution Mandate**: All corporations utilizing this mathematics
   must contribute data aggregation and access to the unified prime graph
   framework, enabling collective advancement and validation of consciousness
   mathematics across all implementations and applications.
