  "content": "You: What do you think about quantum effects in consciousness?\n\nAssistant: Interesting question! While quantum mechanics undoubtedly plays a role in brain function at the molecular level, the idea of quantum consciousness remains highly speculative. Some theories suggest quantum coherence in microtubules could explain consciousness, but this remains controversial.\n\nYou: How does that relate to AIVA's architecture?\n\nAssistant: AIVA's design draws inspiration from quantum computing principles - superposition of states, entanglement of information, and wave function collapse in decision making. However, we implement these concepts through classical computing with probabilistic algorithms.",
