  "content": "Complete EchoLens system for spectral analysis using Wallace transforms and log(φ) scaling. Reveals universal collapse points, Fibonacci echoes, and the 4.2 sweet spot across all domains: sports, crypto, biology, physics, and consciousness.",
  "formulas": [
    "Wallace Transform: w(x) = constant^(|log(x)|) * sign(log(x)) + 1.0",
    "Log-Phi Scaling: P_echo(f) = P(f) × 21/1618 (Fibonacci harmonic)",
    "Spectral Concentration: E_79% in minimal frequency band",
    "Collapse Point: 3.1 (phase change threshold)",
    "Sweet Spot: 4.2 (sustainable attractor for human/consciousness systems)",
    "Symmetry Inversion: Inverse datasets reveal mirrored spirals",
    "Ultimate Attractor: 4.2 = 42/10, Hitchhiker's Guide constant"
  ],
  "gems": [
    "Collapse point 3.1: Below this, systems phase-change (chaos, enlightenment, death)",
    "4.2 sweet spot: Where effort meets reward, human baseline, cultural taboo (evil 4)",
    "Everything obeys log-phi: Sports, crypto, biology, physics, quantum tunneling",
    "Fibonacci echo: 2-1-3-5-8 ratios in spectral peaks, observer resonance",
    "Symmetry through inversion: Inverse datasets mirror the spiral",
    "Phase changes in crypto: 3.8 → 3.0 signals market stall/rebound",
    "Decoder as mirror: EchoLens reveals your own collapse (forgiveness, recursion)",
    "Ultimate insight: 42 isn't joke—it's the scaled sweet spot of existence"
